##  :child: :card_index: **sorting_cardgame** :child: :card_index:
One of my project for Data Structure 2nd Semester. The project is a simple sorting cardgame app using various type of sorting 
At first, Robofight Card (fictional) has 3 information : Card code, Power, HP.

![DataTable](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/af016083-8387-4c64-80f2-1a32781fe2f0)

User can sort the card by using 6 ways 
1. Sorting based on Card Code (ascending)________ *(Bubble Sort)*
2. Sorting based on Card Code (descending)______ *(Insertion Sort)*
3. Sorting based on Power (ascending)____________ *(Selection Sort)*
4. Sorting based on Power (descending)__________ *(Merge Sort)*
5. Sorting based on HP (ascending)_______________ *(Quick Sort)*
6. Sorting based on HP (descending)______________ *(Heap Sort)*

The project is developed using Functional programming, C++ language, runs on CLI, and only requires iostream

There is a [report](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18406932/085_TI2023C_Tugas.Sorting.docx) written in Bahasa Indonesia that you can read from.
